# Python and Flask

### About Python

### About Flask

Flask was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo:

"It came out of an April Fool's joke but proved popular enough to make into a serious application in its own right."

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python, and is based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine, both of them Pocoo projects that were created.

Micro-framework are normally framework with little to no dependencies to external libraries or particular tools. This has pros and cons:

	Pros
	* The framework is light
	* There are little dependency to update and watch for security bugs

	Cons 
	* You will have to do more work by yourself
	* Increase yourself the list of dependencies by adding plugins. 

### Flask popularity

Despite the lack of a major release, Flask has become extremely popular among Python enthusiasts. As of mid 2016, it was the most popular Python web development framework on GitHub.

### Installation

1. open Terminal and run:
2. **brew install python**
3. **pip install -U pip setuptools**
4. **pip install virtualenv** (Virtualenv enables multiple side-by-side installations of Python, one for each project. It doesnâ€™t actually install separate copies of Python, but it does provide a clever way to keep different project environments isolated.)

### Creating the Project Structure

1. cd Desktop
2. mkdir python_flask
3. cd python_flask
4. **virtualenv venv**
5. **source venv/bin/activate** 
	(Whenever you want to work on a project, you only have to activate the corresponding environment.) 
6. **pip install Flask**
7. mkdir static
8. cd static
9. mkdir css
10. cd css
11. touch main.css (most of the code provided by Lynda tutorial)
12. cd ..
13. mkdir js
14. mkdir img
15. cd ..
16. mkdir templates
17. cd templates
18. touch about.html (most of the code provided by Lynda tutorial)
19. touch index.html (most of the code provided by Lynda tutorial)
20. touch layout.html (most of the code provided by Lynda tutorial)
21. cd ..
22. touch routes.py (most of the code provided by Lynda tutorial)
23. touch readme.md
24. **python routes.py**
25. **open the browser and go to localhost:5000**
